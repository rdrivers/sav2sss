<h1>SAV2SSS - SPSS .sav file to Triple-S XML convertor - version 0.3</h1>

<p>The sav2sss utility converts an SPSS® .sav file to Triple-S XML metadata and
data.</p>

<p>sav2sss is written based on the description of the .sav file format to be
found in the <a
href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/pspp/doc/dev/system-file-format.texi?root=pspp&amp;revision=1.2&amp;content-type=text%2Fplain">PSPP
documentation.</a></p>

<p>The description is unsupported and unendorsed by IBM® SPSS® and the results
cannot be warranted in any way.</p>

<p>sav2sss with the &#x2018;full&#x2019; option produces a frequency
distribution of data values, which may be checked against known totals for the
dataset.</p>

<h2>Installation on Windows</h2>

<p>Download the sav2sss executable into a folder of your own choice, let's say
&lt;some-folder&gt;</p>

<p>NB: If not installed already (they almost certainly are on a modern Windows
system) your system requires the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29">Microsoft
Visual C 2008 runtime DLLs</a>.</p>

<h2>Running sav2sss</h2>

<p>sav2sss must be executed from a command prompt:</p>
<pre>&lt;some-folder&gt;\sav2sss [-ooutputEncoding] [-v] [-s] [-f] [-iIdent] [-yYes] [-nNo] -a[delimiter] [-bdelimiter] [-mAnswers...] SAV-file</pre>

<p>Switches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The -v switch if specified displays the savschema version number.</li>
  <li>The -s switch disables "sensible string lengths". This is a default
    option useful for data sets coming from Quancept ® which may have extremely
    long string variable lengths. By default each long string variable is
    reduced to a length no greater than the next power of 2 greater than the
    maximum size found in the file.</li>
  <li>The -f switch enables "full" output that includes:
    <ul>
      <li>A description of the information about each variable found in the
      file</li>
      <li>A listing of the value labels found in the file</li>
      <li>A frequency distribution for the variables in the file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The -o switch specifies the encoding to be used in the output data file,
    by default iso-8859-1 (which should be fine for English-speaking Windows
    users).</li>
  <li>The -i switch may be used to specify the record Ident for the Triple-S
    specification; it should be a single Latin character A-Z. The default is
  A.</li>
  <li>The -y switch specifies the label used for Yes answers (default Yes)</li>
  <li>The -n switch specifies the label used for No answers (default No)</li>
  <li>The -a switch specifies the delimiter between a varying prefix and an
    unvarying suffix in labels of component variables of multiples. If there
    are no variables composed in this way in the file, use a blank. Default is
    blank, i.e. "-a "; <em>note that if a switch value contains blanks it and
    its value should be enclosed in quotes</em>.</li>
  <li>The -b switch specifies the delimiter between an unvarying prefix and a
    varying suffix in labels of component variables of multiples. If there are
    no variables composed in this way in the file, use a blank. Default is
    colon, i.e.. -b:</li>
  <li>The -m switch specifies the answer labels used for 1st answer, 2nd answer
    etctera in spread multiples. The default is "-m:1st answer,:2nd answer,:3rd
    answer,:4th answer,:5th answer,:6th answer,:7th answer,:8th answer". This
    allows spread multiple variables to be distinguised from grids. Specify as
    many answers as there may be responses to any of the spread multiples in
    the .sav file.</li>
  <li>The -x switch can be used to specify the value of the 'user' element in
    the XML file. The value should not contain a semicolon (';') character.
    Note that switches whose values contain spaces should be enclosed in double
    quotes in the command line as shown above. The user element does not
    appear by default.  </li>
  <li>The -h switch is used to specify an href attribute for the &lt;record&gt;
    element. By default sav2sss includes an href which is a relative reference
    to the .asc file. To exclude the href use
    <pre>"-h "</pre>
  </li>
  <li>The -t switch is used to specify contents of either of the &lt;name&gt;
    and &lt;title&gt; elements in the XML. Separate the name and title by a
    semicolon. There is no default name or title. If there is no semicolon the
    whole value is used as the title. E.g.
    <pre>"-tOmnibus201401:January 2014 Omnibus survey"</pre>
    Name is 'Omnibus201401' and title is 'January 2014 Omnibus survey'
    <pre>"-tJanuary 2014 Omnibus survey"</pre>
    No name, and title is 'January 2014 Omnibus survey' </li>
</ul>

<h4>Metadata</h4>

<p>The contents of the &lt;user&gt; element may be controlled by the -x
parameter as described above. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The &lt;date&gt; element shows the date of the SAV2SSS run</li>
  <li>The &lt;time&gt; element shows the time of day of the SAV2SSS run</li>
  <li>The &lt;origin&gt; element contains
    <pre>SAV2SSS {version} (Windows) by Computable Functions (http://www.computable-functions.com)</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Character encodings</h4>

<p>Sav files have the ability to store text in several different encodings
internally. This should be retrieved correctly by sav2sss but it has not been
tested with a wide variety of character sets. Any encoding provided in the <a
href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings">Python
standard library</a> may be used as the data encoding. Characters from the sav
file that are not representable in the specified data encoding are rendered in
the data file as ?. The XML is always written in encoding ISO-8859-1, so all
Unicode characters are representable, and the XML file should be easily viewed
and edited on Windows machines. The data file is written by default with
encoding CP1252; this is a superset of ISO-8859-1 that is almost universally
recognised.</p>

<h2>Multiple categorical variables</h2>

<p>These variables are represented in .sav files by a sequence of consecutive
regular variables, identifiable as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there is one variable per category of the multiple, in the sequence of
    the categories</li>
  <li>each variable has the same root name with an underscore followed by an
    integer as a suffix (with some complications where adding the suffix makes
    the variable name into a long name)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with one of the following scenarios:</p>

<h4>Bitstring representation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>each variable has a title comprised of the underlying multiple variable
    title with the answer label of the corresponding category</li>
  <li>each variable has an answer list containing either:
    <ul>
      <li>exactly two answers coded as zero (answer not applicable) or one
        (answer applicable)</li>
      <li>identical answer lists containing a specific label for Yes and
        another for No (as specified by the -y and -n switches)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting Triple-S multiple has regular format, with one field per
category containing zero or one.</p>

<p>sav2sss recognises this scenario and exports it in the XML as a Triple-S
multiple variable with the bitstring representation. The data file
representation is identical to that of the sequence of single variables.</p>

<h4>Spread representation</h4>

<p>This representation is used for sparse multiples, where the list of
alternatives may be long but only a few selections are expected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each variable has a label comprised of the underlying multiple variable
    title with with the standard answer (from the -m switch) corresponding to
    its position in the sequence of components. I.e. using the defaults, the
    first variable label will contain "1st answer", the second "2nd answer" and
    so on.</li>
  <li>Each variable has an identical answer list</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting Triple-S multiple has 'spread' format, with one field per
component variable.</p>

<h4>Prefixes/suffixes</h4>

<p>The variation in component variable labels may come at the beginning of the
label, i.e. the labels have a fixed suffix which is the underlying question
label, or at the end, i.e. the labels use the question label as a fixed prefix
with the category label at the end. The prefix or suffix is separated from the
varying part by a delimiter, typically a colon (:). You may specify either a
prefix or a suffix, but not presently both, using the -a or -b switches. The
default is to look for an unvarying prefix separated from the varying suffix by
a colon as delimiter. The delimiter is not included in the XML, and may be
longer than one character, e.g. "-b: ".</p>

<h4>Consistency</h4>

<p>sav2sss assumes that coding conventions will be consistent in any one .sav
file, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>where the Yes/No representation of multiples is used, the same answer
    labels are always used for Yes and No.</li>
  <li>where spread representation is used, the same labels are always used for
    the first answer, second answer etcetera.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Values marked as being in time/date format in the sav file are not
    translated. The timestamp values in the files seem to be well outside the
    Unix epoch. So time/date format values are translated as missing values.
    NB: character strings recording time and/or date are not affected; only
    variables explicitly defined as time/date values.</li>
  <li>This may be an instance of a more general problem that some
    floating-point values in .sav files seem to be eleven times larger than one
    would expect, depending on the context in the sav file. sav2sss tries to
    take account of this context but without understanding of the motivation
    this is clearly perilous.</li>
  <li>Numeric fields are assigned digits and decimal places based on a
    combination of the information about formats in the sav file and the actual
    values found. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the source (for Python developers)</h2>

<h4>Prequisites</h4>

<p>sav2sss requires the XML library <a
href="http://xmlsoft.org/python.html">libxml2</a> ( and specifically these <a
href="http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/">Python bindings</a>).</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>To run sav2sss in the interpreter run the script savschema.py</p>

<h4>Building</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the sources</li>
  <li>Building the Windows executable requires the <a
    href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe library</a>. </li>
